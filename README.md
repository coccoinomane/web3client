Batteries-included client to interact with blockchains and smart contracts.

# Features

- Easily create a client to interact with EVM-compatible chains.
- Support for ERC20 operations, using the token name (e.g. USDC) instead of address.
- Preconfigured for the most popular chains: Ethereum, Binance, Avalanche and more to come!
- Exposes the underlying web3.py client to allow for more flexibility

# Examples

Get the latest block on both Ethereum, BNB Chain and Avalanche:

```python
from web3factory.factory import make_client

eth_block = make_client('ethereum').getLatestBlock()
bnb_block = make_client('binance').getLatestBlock()
avax_block = make_client('avalanche').getLatestBlock()
```

Get the ETH and USDC balances of the Ethereum foundation:

```python
from web3factory.factory import make_client, make_erc20_client

address = "0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae"
eth = make_client("ethereum").getBalanceInEth(address)
usdc = make_erc20_client("USDC", "ethereum").balanceOf(address) / 10**6
```

Get the BNB and BUSD balances of Binance's hot wallet:

```python
from web3factory.factory import make_client, make_erc20_client

address = "0x8894e0a0c962cb723c1976a4421c95949be2d4e3"
bnb = make_client("binance").getBalanceInEth(address)
busd = make_erc20_client("BUSD", "binance").balanceOf(address) / 10**18
```
