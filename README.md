Easy to use Python client to interact with multiple EVM blockchain.

# Features

- Easily create a client to interact with EVM-compatible chains.
- Preconfigured for the most popular chains: Ethereum, Binance, Avalanche, Cronos, etc.
- Support for ERC20 operations, using the token name (e.g. USDC) instead of address.
- Exposes the underlying web3.py client to allow for more flexibility

# Examples

Get the latest block on both Ethereum and Avalanche:

```python
from web3factory.factory import make_client

eth_block = make_client('ethereum').getLatestBlock()
avax_block = make_client('avalanche').getLatestBlock()
```

Find the USDC balance of the Ethereum foundation:

```python
from web3factory.factory import make_erc20_client

address = "0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae"
usdc_balance = make_erc20_client("USDC", "ethereum").balanceOf(address)
```

# Install

```bash
pip3 install -U web3client
```

# It doesn't work ðŸ˜¡
